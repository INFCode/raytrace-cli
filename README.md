# raytrace-cli

Ray-tracing, but in CLI.

This project is a hands-on exploration inspired by Peter Shirley's renowned book  [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). It began as a quest to build a simple ray-tracing demo in the terminal, rendering ASCII art, but now evolved into a more comprehensive framework that also supports image output.

__It's a toy project, created for learning and fun. I hope you have fun!__
